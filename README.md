# REMUSCLES

## Decsription

Coach part of the project. You can create a training block for an athlete, change everything (exercise, sets, load...) and see the training volume by muscle group or by movement.
The objectif is to create easily a training block, based on a working system. The atlhete will see what he need to do.
The other part is for the athlete. Both of the app use the same database.


## Planing todo

- Use of the "tonnage" along side with the volume
- Management of EMOM sets
- Automatic calcul of effectives reps with the reps and RPE of the sets. (major driver in hypertrophy)
- Automatic suggestion of minimal load, based on what we want to work (Strengh, Explosiviy, Hyperthrophy...)
- See exactly what the atlhete has done. (already in bdd but need an interface)
